My name is Keyanshu Gariba, and I am a Master's student in Software Engineering at Northeastern University with a strong background in full-stack development and scalable systems. I came across the opportunity at Nonsense and was excited to see the alignment with my skills in Flutter (Dart), React.js, Node.js, and backend development using Spring Boot and Python.<br><br>  \nDuring my internships, I built cross-platform applications, optimized databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), and deployed scalable solutions using AWS—directly matching your needs. My experience in RESTful APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and agile development would allow me to contribute immediately to your mission of revolutionizing civic tech.<br><br>  \nI’d love the chance to discuss how my background fits your vision. Thank you for your time and consideration."
